      <ul>
        <li>(High Volume) Data Migration from SQL to NoSQL 
      
      <p>What?
        The requirement was to migarte 100s of GBs of data from MSSQL Server 2000 to MongoDB. This data powered around 
          7000 websites across North America and Canada for a Fortune 500 Company in the automobile space. The first step was
          to understand the SQL Schema (there were around 150 tables, normalized to BCNF), and the new Mongo structure. The 
          structure had evolved with some new business usecases, and some functionality being deprecated. Which meant that even 
          while migating it wasn't a "pick-and-place" job but involved a lot of business logic in-between. </p>

          One of which was the Number 1 iPhone application for around 3-4 months after its launch, and still features
          in Top 10 newspapers apps. </p>

      <ol>
      Short-term:
      <li>Tackle problems you face each day while maintaining the most optimal proportion of efficiency and speed. And also (this is important) make notes of what you learn in the process.</li>
      <li>Make notes of everyday ideas you have, the problems you come across and how can you contribute towards a solution.</li>
      <li>Maintain sanity while doing the above, (music and of-course my family are a big help).</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
      Long-term:
      <li>Finally decide upon and invest sometime on one of the problems I have assimilated and try coming up with a viable solution.</li>
      <li>If (1. = a success), gather whatever resources required and implement it. </li>
      <li>If (2. = a success), spend sometime feeling content and at peace.</li>
      <li>If (3. = a success), start again at 1.</li>

          <h3><a name="technologies" class="anchor" href="#technologies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical Skillset</h3>
<p>
  Honestly I don't believe that a developer/innovator should limit himself (or his thought process) to any technology. Technology is a small part of the end solution, and the main job is come up with the solution. Still, as of now, I have worked on a number of things. 
  <ul><li>
    I have written code in C/C++, Java, Python, Ruby. (Proficiency in respective order)
  </li>
  <li>
  I have worked on iOS application development. I am well versed with Cocoa Touch, and Cocos2D frameworks.
  </li>
  <li>
  I have used deep end web frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails. Plus, their lightweight counterparts (in terms of scripting language that is) like Flask and Sinatra. 
  </li>
  <li>
  I am pretty good at SQL. And can do reasonably well with NoSQL as well (MongoDB mostly). 
  -- Adding a quick point here, I don't like the term NoSQL. Makes it sound like there is no schema, no structure to it. Which isn't true at all. The only thing majorly absent are object relationships. 
  </li>
  <li>And at the end I would like to add, I am Jack of all these trades, and definitely Master of none. Being a master takes time. And you can only be a master when you have had a taste of everything else. </li>
